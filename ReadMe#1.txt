Introduction: 

Chicken Invaders is a classic arcade style shooting game from my childhood. This game is my take on the famous chicken Invaders game where the player controls a spaceship to shoot invading chickens who have taken control over the universe. The objective is to score as high as possible by shooting chickens and collecting power ups while avoiding eggs dropped by the chickens.

Controls: 

1. Hovering Mouse: Controls the movement of the spaceship

Powerups:
 
1. Bolt sign (flash.png): +1's the laser beam shot by spaceship

3. Chicken(chicken_leg.png): +1's the player life 

Note: On click to start window keep your mouse to the bottom of the game screen or else it will result in loss of lives in case of collisions with the chicken
